    *** DEVELOPER NOTE: FIX FOR 'auth/unauthorized-domain' ERROR ***
    
    If you are seeing a 'Firebase: Error (auth/unauthorized-domain)' error in your console,
    it is NOT a bug in this code. It is a security setting in your Firebase project.

    Here is the step-by-step fix:
    1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
    2. Select your project: 'timelesswhispers-37f98'
    3. Go to 'Authentication' (in the left-hand menu).
    4. Go to the 'Settings' tab (at the top of the Authentication page).
    5. Find the 'Authorized domains' list.
    6. Click 'Add domain'.
    7. Type in your website's domain: flynn-maxwel.github.io
    8. Click 'Add'.

    Wait 1-2 minutes, then reload your website. The error will be gone and sign-in will work.
