    *** DEVELOPER NOTE: REFACTORED FOR CANVAS ENVIRONMENT ***
    
    This file has been updated to integrate with the standard
    Firebase services provided in this environment.

    - Authentication:
      Removed Google Sign-In (`signInWithPopup`).
      Replaced with automatic `signInWithCustomToken` (if provided)
      or `signInAnonymously` as per the environment mandate.
      User auth is now handled on page load.

    - Firestore Database Paths:
      All collection and document paths (for users, likes, reflections,
      newsletter) have been updated to use the mandated
      `/artifacts/{appId}/...` structure for security and
      multi-tenancy.

    - "Save" Feature Consolidation:
      Removed the `localStorage`-based "Favorite" (♥) feature.
      Consolidated all logic into the Firestore-based "Save" (⭐) feature.
      The "Favorites" filter is now "Saved" and reads from the user's
      Firestore document, making it persistent.
      
    - Theme Transition (11/07/2025):
      Removed inline styles from JS render functions.
      Added CSS classes for all themed elements.
      Added global CSS transitions for smooth theme toggling.
      Simplified `toggleTheme()` function.
